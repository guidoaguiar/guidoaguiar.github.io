## Overview

It was a great challeng made me think a lot, i know that I need to improve a lot to make it responsiveness so any feedback is appreciated.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The use of variables on CSS sheet and the importance of hierachy on the code.

Variables:
```css
:root {
  --font-family: "Overpass", sans-serif;
  body {
    background-color: var(--background-color);
```

### Continued development

I'm still trying to understand how to better code for responsiveness.
