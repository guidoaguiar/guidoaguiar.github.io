## Welcome to GitHub Pages
## GitHub OnePager Demo

=====================

This demo was created for use in demos and trainings to have educators play with GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Jekyll.

=====================

[This post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) is a great resource to understand the what you're doing. 

Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages are all very closely related. Imagine Git as the workflow to get things done and GitHub and GitHub Pages as places to store the work you finish. Projects that use Git are stored publicly in GitHub and GitHub Pages, so in a very generalized way, Git is what you do locally on your own computer and GitHub is the place where all this gets stored publicly on a server.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a project over time. It typically records what the changes were (what was added? what was removed from the file?), who made the changes, notes and comments about the changes by the changer, and at what time the changes were made. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web hosting service for the source code of software and web development projects (or other text based projects) that use Git. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are public webpages hosted for free through GitHub. GitHub users can create and host both personal websites (one allowed per user) and websites related to specific GitHub projects.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a very powerful static site generator. In some senses, it is a throwback to the days of static HTML before databases were used to store website content. For simple sites without complex architectures, like a personal website, this is a huge plus. When used alongside GitHub, Jekyll will automatically re-generate all the HTML pages for your website each time you commit a file.

Whenever you commit to this repository in GitHub, GitHub Pages will run Jekyll to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files. You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Keep [this page open} (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to help you as you write, edit, and revise.
